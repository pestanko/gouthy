and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers apps.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// appsGetCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// appsGetCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
